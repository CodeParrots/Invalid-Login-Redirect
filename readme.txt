Limit the number of times that users can attempt to login using a wrong password before being redirected to a custom page.

== Description ==

Determine the number of times that registered users can attempt to login using a wrong password before they are redirected to the lost password page, or a custom URL of your choosing.

The redirect will work for registered users on your site. If a user attempts to login multiple times with a username or email that is not registered on the site, they will not be redirected.
